We are trying to set up a speed gaming experience and we are going crazy. The idea is that, when 6 men and 6 women sign up, they can play each one of the six games (in six different tables) in couples (m/f) Here's the problem: There are 6 games in six tables. The participants are 6 women and 6 men. The idea is that each woman plays each one of the six games with each one of the six men. Also, each man should experience the same: play the six games that are in the six tables, each one of them with one of the six women. Is there a way of moving people across tables so we can manage that in six turns? We are trying to work it out and we can't. Sorry if I repeated myself, I just wanted to explain the problem properly. Also the games in each table are logical riddles so this is very meta. Thanks!
